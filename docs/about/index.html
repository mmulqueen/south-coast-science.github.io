    <h2 id="our-story">Our story</h2>
<p>South Coast Science was founded in 2016 as a response to a market call for a standard digital front-end for Alphasense electrochemical sensors. A gap in the market was identified for an electronic interface between electrochemical sensors and industry-standard microcontrollers, including Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone. The result was a project that more than matched its brief.</p>

<p>The company was founded by three engineers with experience in environmental science, ultra-low noise analogue electronics, precision electronics manufacture, device firmware, and cloud data infrastructure. The fourth part of our team is Alphasense, South Coast Science’s founding investor and technical partner. Together, we have developed unique approaches to the problems of part-per-billion gas concentration monitoring at a realistic cost.</p>

<p>In addition to activity in electrochemical sensing, our products support particulate monitoring, photoionisation detector (PID), and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. South Coast Science’s customers range from electronic engineers working in the development of scientific equipment, through to those in need of packaged solutions in environmental science, environmental health, workplace health, and air conditioning equipment monitoring and management.</p>

<p>South Coast Science offers key differentiators in the field of environmental monitoring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A core design, based on experience in low-noise design and environmental science practice, that rejects exactly the upper frequency noise that typically disrupts attempts to read gas electrochems.</li>
  <li>An open-source software stack that provides out-of- the-box internet connectivity to standard, open data infrastructures, using the emerging environmental metadata standards.</li>
  <li>For each product, a set of deliverables giving the most flexibility to the customer, from circuit boards to out-of-the-box solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>South Coast Science continues to develop gas electrochemical systems, related hardware and open software solutions, optimised for specific monitoring settings.
