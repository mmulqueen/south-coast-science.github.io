            <p> South Coast Science is a 21st Century scientific instrument maker.
                We design and build high-precision, affordable, highly-connected environmental monitoring devices,
                circuits and
                open-source software. From our inception we have been partnered with sensor specialists Alphasense and
                data infrastructure providers OpenSensors.io, both powerful innovators in their field.

                <h2>Products</h2>
                <p>
                    We deliver a range of products that can sample gas concentrations within plus or minus five parts
                    per billion. Data can then be securely stored, distributed globally to the public or to any other
                    type of organisation.
                    South Coast Scienceâ€™s electronics are the result of a working collaboration between ultra-low noise
                    specialists, electrochemical sensor experts, and environmental scientists.
                    Each South Coast Science product is adapted to specific use cases, covering internal and external
                    air
                    monitoring,
                    and electrochemical component evaluation.
                    We offer a modular range of equipment across a grid of gas types, host microcontrollers,
                    and product deliverables.</p>
